But when Kelly started thinking about his old songs and the album Graffiti On The Train, he also thought about his friend Stuart Cable, who passed away three years ago. Stuart was the original drummer in the band Stereophonics. He lived next door to Kelly and the bass player Richard Jones, but he had problems with drugs and alcohol, which made him leave the band in 2003. Kelly still thinks about Stuart every day and misses him. He says they did a lot together with Stuart, Richard, and himself. When Stuart left, it was a tough time, but they got back in touch after 15 months and played a special show at a friend's wedding in Wales."

This method allows for efficient use of network resources and improves reliability by enabling multiple data streams to share the same network connection."

The angle at base $AD$ is $60^\\circ$, and the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ are both $10\\sqrt{21}$ in length. \n\nLet’s place the trapezoid on the coordinate plane to simplify calculations. Assume $A$ is at the origin, $A = (0, 0)$, and $D$ is on the x-axis, say $D = (d, 0)$ for some $d > 0$. Since the angle at $A$ is $60^\\circ$, the side $AB$ makes an angle of $60^\\circ$ with the base $AD$, and similarly for side $CD$.\n\nLet’s determine the height of the trapezoid. The height $h$ is the perpendicular distance between the two bases. Using trigonometry and the angle $60^\\circ$, the height is:\n$$\nh = AB \\cdot \\sin(60^\\circ) = AB \\cdot \\frac"
